# Admin Dashboard Documentation

for admin dashboard docco pages:

- each page should contain a list of the fields that need to be filled out to create a new entry and a short explanation of each
- explain any noteworthy cases where filling out a field a certain way causes a major difference on the frontend. e.g. rendering an itch widget vs a non itch widget
- for fields that need information to be filled from itch.io, a description of where to get this information from should be included
- the process for adding, managing, and removing admin accounts who can access the admin site
